# Brain Tumor Dectection Model
This repository contains three models that were develop using CNN algorithm to check brain MRI scans for a pituatary tumor. The dataset used was small so deep, complex CNN architectures would not generalize properly and may overfit. However this project was a school project made for learning purposes.
