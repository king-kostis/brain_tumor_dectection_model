# Brain Tumor Dectection Model
This repository contains three models that were developed using CNN algorithm to check brain MRI scans for a pituatary tumor. The dataset used was insufficient so complex CNN architectures would not generalize properly and may mildly overfit. However this project was a school project made for learning purposes. <br><br>
